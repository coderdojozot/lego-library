This is Pybricks code for classification of bricks using aiBrick, 
TeachableMachine AI/ML model and camera in PC/Laptop/Smartphone. 
6 classes are recognized:
* Technic Beam 1 x 3 Thick
* Technic Beam 1 x 5 Thick
* Technic Beam 2 x 4 L-Shape Thick
* Technic Beam 3 x 5 L-Shape Thick
* Technic Beam 3 x 3 T-Shape Thick
* No brick
